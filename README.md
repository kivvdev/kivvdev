Been devving since 11. 
> *12th January 2025*
- Current interests are front-end webdev, Flutter, networking, and browser extensions.
- Twitch chats and Minecraft plugins are pretty cool, I think.
- Mostly trying to make practical tools, also hoping to master the skills I'm already okay at; webdev & Flutter mainly.
